- 👋 Hi, I’m @zPlacd, or rather Pedro Plácido
- 👀 I’m interested in information and technological systems.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning mobile programming and web programming, tinkering with React Native and PHP for now.
- 💞️ I'm developing a project in React for an event, in this project I have 3 more friends. Already here on my GitHub you will have more information and codes about this system.
